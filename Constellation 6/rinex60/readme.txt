Installation Instructions

The RINEX Toolbox is normally contained on a PC-based 3.5", 1.44Mb floppy disk. 
Other formats are such as an e-mail delivery are also available. 

For PC users, the Toolbox is distributed as a self-extracting zip file.  
To install, double click on the self-extracting zip file named rinex6.zip.  
When prompted for an "unzip" directory, use the same root as the Constellation 
Toolbox (....\Constell for a typical Constellation Toolbox installation shown below) 
and add a subdirectory called RINEX.  The resulting file structre should be:

...\constell		- contains Constellation Toolbox toolbox functions (previously installed)
...\constell\demo	- contains the Constellation Toolbox GUI-based demo (previously installed)
...\constell\tutorial	- contains the Constellation Toolbox tutorial code (previously installed)
...\constell\RINEX	- contains the RINEX Toolbox code (this installation)

Unix users will be provided a floppy disk with the Toolbox stored as a tar file.  The directory 
structure described above should be created and the files copied into the appropriate directory 
from the installation disk.



Add the toolbox directory to your MATLAB path

The toolbox is accessible from all directories when on your MATLAB path.

Use the graphical path editing tool available in the base MATLAB environment to add the 
Constell\RINEX directory (following the example above) to your path.  We recommend you add this to 
the back or end of your MATLAB path. 


Your RINEX Toolbox installation is now complete.
